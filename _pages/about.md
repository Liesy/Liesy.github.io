<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at the Media Synthesis and Forensics Lab (formerly known as Multimedia Computing Group), [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/), advised by Professor [Juan Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fSBdNg0AAAAJ) and Associate Professor (Researcher) [Qiang Sheng](https://sheng-qiang.github.io).

My research interests include identifying and regulating content generated by large language models (大语言模型时代下的内容安全治理), such as machine-generated texts, toxic content, and fake news.

<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D09OAbQAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> -->

[From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring](https://liesy.github.io/SCM/)

<u><font size=4>Yang Li</font></u>, Qiang Sheng, Yehan Yang, Xueyao Zhang, Juan Cao

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->

- **Data:** We construct **FineHarm**, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training.
- **Model:** We propose the **Streaming Content Monitor (SCM)**, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness.
